    <p> The above image is a screenshot from a game of Nethack. Somehow, despite having played this game on and off for several years, I have yet to make any significant progress. This is likely in part caused by my adamant refusal to get spoilers from the internet. Despite this aversion, I've picked up a few hints over the years: </p>
    <ol>
      <li> Writing the word "Elbereth" on the ground can bring good luck. With the countless perils in the dungeon, this can potentially be instrumental to your success in the game. </li>
      <li> Using a wand or potion of enlightenment can help you determine what abilities you've picked up on your journey</li>
      <li> Eating a fortune cookie and visiting the Oracle will both provide you with hints, but the Oracle is the more reliable of the two by a large margin. I have not encountered the Oracle.</li>
    </ol>

    <p> One of the best elements in Nethack in my opinion is its innumerable easter eggs. Since the game came out in 1987, it has had many different contributions from many different people. It would take you a very long time to see all there is to see in the game. </p>
    <p> You can   <a href="https://www.nethack.org/v366/downloads.html">download Nethack</a> and play for yourself</p>

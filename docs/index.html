    <p> The above image is a screenshot from a game of Nethack. Here are some tips: </p>
    <ol>
      <li> Writing the word "Elbereth" on the ground can bring good luck. With the countless perils in the dungeon, this can potentially be instrumental to your success in the game. </li>
      <li> Using a wand or potion of enlightenment can help you determine what abilities you've picked up on your journey</li>
      <li> Eating a fortune cookie and visiting the Oracle will both provide you with hints, but the Oracle is the more reliable of the two by a large margin. I have not encountered the Oracle.</li>
    </ol>

    <p> Since the game came out in 1987, it has had many different contributions from many different people. It would take you a very long time to see all there is to see in the game. </p>
    <p> You can   <a href="https://www.nethack.org/v366/downloads.html">download Nethack</a> and play for yourself</p>
